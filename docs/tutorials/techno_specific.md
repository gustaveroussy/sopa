# Technology-specific advice

Sopa is designed to run on all spatial technologies at single-cell resolution, but some choices or parameters may be more or less suited to certain technologies.

!!! note
    All this advice is for the API usage, but it also applies to the CLI and the Snakemake pipeline (update the usage accordingly or look at our [per-technology Snakemake configs](https://github.com/gustaveroussy/sopa/tree/main/workflow/config)).

## Xenium or MERSCOPE

For Xenium or MERSCOPE data, we recommend using a transcript-based segmentation tool, e.g., Baysor or Proseg. With the Xenium 5k panel, Proseg is recommended due to its fast results and high quality.

To use the prior 10X or Vizgen segmentation, you need to precise it in [`sopa.make_transcript_patches`](../../api/patches/#sopa.make_transcript_patches) - with `sopa>=2.0.4`, use `prior_shapes_key="auto"` to automatically detect the prior and use it for Baysor/Proseg.

```python
sopa.make_transcript_patches(sdata, prior_shapes_key="auto") # for proseg, also add patch_width=None
```

If using [Baysor](../../api/segmentation/#sopa.segmentation.baysor), you can also use `area=20` to filter cells with an area below 20 um².

To filter low-quality cells, you can provide `min_transcripts=20` to the [aggregation](../../api/aggregation/#sopa.aggregate).

## CosMx

For CosMx data, the same advice as above is applicable, although you may experience some issues when reading the data with `sopa.io.cosmx` due to some frequent changes in the AtoMX exports. If so, please [open an issue](https://github.com/gustaveroussy/sopa/issues) to improve this.

## Visium HD

See [here](../visium_hd) the full Visium HD specific tutorial.

## MACSima or PhenoCycler

For spatial proteomics, [Cellpose](../../api/segmentation/#sopa.segmentation.cellpose) is needed. To avoid having artifacts outside of the tissue, we recommend running [`sopa.segmentation.tissue`](../../api/segmentation/#sopa.segmentation.tissue) before running Cellpose. This way, Cellpose will run only inside the tissue.

For MACSima, we recommend to use `diameter=35` pixels and `min_area=400` pixels² to [`sopa.segmentation.cellpose`](../../api/segmentation/#sopa.segmentation.cellpose). For PhenoCycler data, it will depend on the image resolution, so you'll need to choose a diameter (in pixels) that is biologically relevant.

During [aggregation](../../api/aggregation/#sopa.aggregate), you can for instance use `expand_radius_ratio=0.1` to expand the cells, `min_intensity_ratio=0.1` to filter cells with a too low intensity.

## H&E or WSI

If you have only a H&E/WSI slide without spatial omics, you can also use Sopa, although many operations are dedicated to spatial omics. For instance, [`sopa.segmentation.tissue`](../../api/segmentation/#sopa.segmentation.tissue) for tissue segmentation, [`sopa.segmentation.stardist`](../../api/segmentation/#sopa.segmentation.stardist) for cell segmentation, [`sopa.patches.compute_embeddings`](../../api/patches/#sopa.patches.compute_embeddings) and [`sopa.patches.cluster_embeddings`](../../api/patches/#sopa.patches.cluster_embeddings) for patches embeddings/clusters.

Though, if you have H&E with spatial omics, e.g. Xenium + H&E, in that case, we recommend segmenting the data on the spatial transcriptomics and aligning the H&E to performed [joined](../../api/spatial/#sopa.spatial.sjoin) operations as in [this tutorial](../he).

!!! note "Sopa WSI extra"
    There is a Sopa extra for WSI, you can install it via `pip install 'sopa[wsi]'`
