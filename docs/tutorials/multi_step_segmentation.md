# Multi-step segmentation

Multi-step segmentation consists of running multiple times Cellpose over the whole slides with different parameters. For instance, we can first run a nucleus segmentation using DAPI, then another round using DAPI and a membrane staining, and finally, DAPI and cell boundary staining. This can make the segmentation more robust. Note that the results of the multiple steps are combined into one final segmentation.

## Using the API

To run multi-step segmentation via the API, you can run multiple segmentation methods, and then combine them with [sopa.segmentation.combine](../../api/segmentation/#sopa.segmentation.combine).

On the example below, we run Cellpose twice, once for nuclei and once for tumor cells. We then combine the two segmentations into a single one.

```python
import sopa

sdata = sopa.io.toy_dataset(length=1000)
sopa.make_image_patches(sdata)

sopa.segmentation.cellpose(sdata, "DAPI", diameter=35, key_added="nuclei")
sopa.segmentation.cellpose(sdata, ["CK", "DAPI"], diameter=35, key_added="tumor_cells")

sopa.segmentation.combine(sdata, ["nuclei", "tumor_cells"], key_added="combined_cells")
```

Then, you can continue as usual, i.e. with `sopa.aggregate` and so on.

## Using the CLI

!!! warning
    Here, we only detail the multi-step segmentation. For the rest of the CLI usage, refer to our [CLI usage tutorial](../cli_usage), and only replace the "Run segmentation" section with the instructions below.

First, generate the bounding boxes of the patches on which Cellpose will be run. Here, the patches have a width and height of 1500 pixels, and an overlap of 50 pixels. We advise bigger sizes for real datasets (see our default parameters in one of our [config files](https://github.com/gustaveroussy/sopa/tree/main/workflow/config)). On the toy dataset, this will generate **4** patches.

```sh
sopa patchify image tuto.zarr --patch-width-pixel 1500 --patch-overlap-pixel 50
```

Now, we can run Cellpose on each of the four patches and for each "segmentation step" we want. In this toy example, we run 3 steps with (i) CK + DAPI, (ii) CD3 + DAPI, and (iii) CD20 + DAPI.

```sh
sopa segmentation cellpose tuto.zarr \
    --channels CK --channels DAPI \
    --cache-dir-name cellpose_CK \
    --diameter 35 \
    --min-area 2000

sopa segmentation cellpose tuto.zarr \
    --channels CD3 --channels DAPI \
    --cache-dir-name cellpose_CD3 \
    --diameter 35 \
    --min-area 2000

sopa segmentation cellpose tuto.zarr \
    --channels CD20 --channels DAPI \
    --cache-dir-name cellpose_CD20 \
    --diameter 35 \
    --min-area 2000
```

!!! Note
    In the above commands, the `--diameter` and `--min-area` parameters are specific to the data type we work on. For your own data, consider using the default parameters from one of our [config files](https://github.com/gustaveroussy/sopa/tree/main/workflow/config). Here, `min-area` is in pixels^2.

At this stage, you executed 12 times Cellpose (3 steps on each of the 4 patches). Now, we need to resolve the conflict, i.e., merge the three segmentations into one. Note that we gave the paths to the temporary boundaries we made above.
```sh
sopa resolve cellpose tuto.zarr \
    --cache-dir-name cellpose_CK \
    --cache-dir-name cellpose_CD3 \
    --cache-dir-name cellpose_CD20
```

Congrats, you have now merged the results of a three-step segmentation! You can now refer to our normal [CLI usage tutorial](../cli_usage) for all the other tasks.
