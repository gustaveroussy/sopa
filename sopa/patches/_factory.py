    !!! info "Prior segmentation usage"
        To save assign a prior segmentation to each transcript, you can use the `prior_shapes_key` argument:

        - If a segmentation has already been performed (for example an existing 10X-Genomics segmentation), use `prior_shapes_key="auto"` to use it (or, provide manually the column name and the `unassigned_value` argument).
        - If you have already run segmentation with Sopa, use `prior_shapes_key` to denote the name of the shapes (GeoDataFrame) containing the boundaries, e.g. `prior_shapes_key="cellpose_boundaries"`.

    Args:
        sdata: A `SpatialData` object.
        patch_width: Width of the patches, in microns. If `None`, creates only one patch.
        patch_overlap: Number of microns of overlap between patches.
        points_key: Optional key of the points on which the patches will be made. If not provided, it is found automatically.
        prior_shapes_key: Optional key of `sdata` containing the shapes with the prior segmentation, or column of the points dataframe. If `"auto"`, use the prior column from the technology.
        unassigned_value: If `prior_shapes_key` has been provided and corresponds to a points column: this argument is the value given to the transcript that are not inside any cell.
        min_points_per_patch: Minimum number of points/transcripts for a patch to be considered for segmentation.
        write_cells_centroids: If `True`, the centroids of the prior cells will be saved. This is useful for some segmentation tools such as ComSeg.
