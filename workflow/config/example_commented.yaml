  # [only if running cellpose]
  cellpose:
    diameter: 55 # [important parameter] typical size of a cell, in pixels. This depends on the technology resolution (see our config files per technology: https://github.com/gustaveroussy/sopa/tree/main/workflow/config)

    flow_threshold: 2 # [optional] see cellpose parameters
    cellprob_threshold: -6 # [optional] see cellpose parameters
    model_type: "cyto3" # [optional] name of the cellpose model to be used. If you have a custom model, use the "pretrained_model" argument instead, and give the path to your model
    min_area: 1000 # [optional] minimum area (in pixels^2) for a cell to not be filtered
    clip_limit: 0.2 # [optional] value used to increase the contrast of the image. 0 means no change, 1 means high contrast change (see skimage.exposure.equalize_adapthist).
    gaussian_sigma: 1 # [optional] sigma used for gaussian smoothing. This can improve segmentation for highly-pixelated images

  # [only if running baysor]
  baysor:
    min_area: 20 # [optional] minimum area (in microns^2) for a cell to not be filtered
    prior_shapes_key: auto # [optional] this allows to use the prior segmentation performed by the provider. This shouldn't be provided if you run cellpose with Sopa.

    # command_line_suffix: "--nthreads XXX" # add here any command line suffix to the proseg command

aggregate:
  aggregate_genes: true # [optional] whether to compute the genes counts for each cell (cell-by-gene matrix)
  aggregate_channels: true # [optional] whether to compute, for each cell, the mean intensity per staining/channel
  min_intensity_ratio: 0.1 # [optional] cells whose mean channel intensity is less than `min_intensity_ratio * quantile_90` will be filtered
  expand_radius_ratio: 0.1 # [optional] cells polygons will be expanded by `expand_radius_ratio * mean_radius` for channels averaging **only**. This help better aggregate boundary stainings

  min_transcripts: 5 # [optional] cells whose transcript count is below that this threshold are filtered

# [optional] if annotation is desired, choose either 'tangram' or 'fluorescence'. If 'fluorescence' is used, make sure 'aggregate_channels' is true (see parameter above)
annotation:
  # [only if you choose transcript-based annotation with Tangram]
  method: tangram
