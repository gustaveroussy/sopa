# Notes
- The `proseg.yaml` config is running Proseg on the prior Vizgen segmentation (also cellpose based). ***Recommended***.
- The `baysor_vizgen.yaml` config is Baysor running on the prior Vizgen segmentation (also cellpose based).
- The `baysor_cellpose.yaml` config is similar to the above, but will run Cellpose with Sopa to provide it as a prior to Baysor.
